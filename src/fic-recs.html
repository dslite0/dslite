<h1>fic recs</h1>

<p>i used to (and from time to time still) read a lot of fanfiction, often for whatever media i'm hyperfixated on at the moment. as a result i have lots to recommend! i really love fanfiction authors and all that they have to offer. if you decide to read any of the fics i recommend, please consider dropping the authors a comment to show your appreciation once you're done!</p>

<p>explicit/nsfw fics are marked with ðŸ”ž. hopefully i've gotten all of them.</p>
