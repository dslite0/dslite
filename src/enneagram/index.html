<h1>the enneagram</h1>

<p>while it's typically called a personality typology system, that might be a bit of a misnomer (depending on how you define "personality").</p>

<p>the enneagram is ultimately a system that is meant to help you grow as a person and move past your limiting beliefs. limiting beliefs and "passions" are what make enneagram types, <em>not</em> surface-level lists of personality traits. this is perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind when diving into the system.</p>

<p>there are nine enneagram types (numbered 1-9), each with their own sets of beliefs about the world, fears, fixations, and virtues.</p>

<h1>where can i learn more?</h1>
<p>i've compiled a list of <a href="/enneagram-resources">resources</a> that i personally used to familiarize myself with the enneagram. feel free to look around!</p> 

<p>i highly recommend going through as many sources as possible to gain a fuller understanding of the system. information about the enneagram is scattered around various different sources, and it's not a scienceâ€”just a framework.</p>
