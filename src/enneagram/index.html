<h1>the enneagram</h1>

<p>the enneagram is often described as a personality type system, though the accuracy of that depends on what you consider to be your "personality". at its core, the enneagram highlights the fears and fixations people have acquired as a result of childhood experiences and wounds. according to enneagram theory, these wounds and the coping mechanisms/adaptations you've made to accomodate for them are what make up your false personality. as a result of learning some kind of message through childhood and adolescence, your attention grew narrowed towards certain fixations and passions. you took on certain behavior patterns to adjust and have your needs met. </p>

<p>there are nine enneagram types (numbered 1-9), each with their own sets of beliefs about the world, fears, fixations, and virtues.</p>

<h1>where can i learn more?</h1>
<p>i've compiled a list of <a href="/resources/enneagram">resources</a> that i personally used to familiarize myself with the enneagram. feel free to look around!</p> 

<p>i highly recommend going through as many sources as possible to gain a fuller understanding of the system. information about the enneagram is scattered around various different sources, and it's not a scienceâ€”just a framework.</p>

<p>practicing trying to type characters and people will also flesh out your knowledge of the enneagram. talk with other people about it, especially those who may have more insight to share on the topic!</p>
