<p>i first started growing mushrooms back in march 2025 because i'd heard of the many positive impacts psilocybin had on others, especially regarding personal growth, spiritual growth, and mental health. the hobby quickly grew into something i was doing just for the fun of it.</p>
<p>psychedelic mushrooms sadly have little to no impact on me outside of inducing nausea due to the meds i take, but i still enjoyed growing gourmet mushrooms such as oyster mushrooms and lion's mane.</p>
<p>it's a great hobby for those who can afford the space for it. the mushroom growing community is also a wonderful and welcoming one from my experience, and people were more than willing to help guide me through the process and direct me towards resources.</p>
<p>as i'm writing this my interest in mushrooms has waned, but i still want to spread the information that i've learned in case anyone else wants to try out growing mushrooms for themselves.</p>
