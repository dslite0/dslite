<p>obsidian is a lightweight and highly customizable markdown editor, meaning it's meant to help manage files in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">markdown</a> (.md) format.</p>

<p>you can use obsidian for all sorts of things, including (but not limited to) note-taking, long-form writing, research, information and knowledge management, and journaling. i personally use obsidian to journal and take notes for my education, as well as keeping track of important information in my life. it effectively replaces other notes apps (such as apple notes) and adds lots of functionality and organization. it's also incredibly fun to tinker with.</p>
