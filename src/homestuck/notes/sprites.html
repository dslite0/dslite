<h1 id="sprites">Sprites</h1>

<ul>
    <li>"Sprites technically can't go far from the house after their player enters the Medium. That's the strict rule of Sburb. Until much, much later, when it stops being all that strict, for reasons that are unlikely ever to be explained," ([S] ACT 4). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"Not all contact with a sprite will result in prototyping. Often minor points of brief or light contact with the sprite won't do it. Like passing your hand quickly over a candle before it burns," (1940) Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"The game has no explicit rule that demands something dead for prototyping. But in practice, the kernelsprite has particular attraction to the deceased or the doomed. Across every session ever played, exceptions to this pattern are extremely rare," (2089).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nannasprite" style="color: #00d5f2;">Nannasprite</h2>

<ul>
    <li>"Prankster's Gambit" was the name of Nanna's old joke shop (92). Author Commentary. (+ 1882)</li>
    <li>"On 4/13, 1910, exactly 99 years prior to John's "birth", baby nanna's meteor destroyed a bakery owned by Betty Crocker."</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="jaspersprite" style="color: #ff6ff2;">Jaspersprite</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Jaspers was likely a result of Mom Lalonde attempting to perfect the science of ectobiology (934).</li>
    <li>Jaspers' body showed up on the shore two weeks after he disappeared (937).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="davesprite" style="color: #f2a400;">Davesprite</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Future Dave made it to the fifth gate before traveling back in time (1641).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"Dave has already been here for <u>months</u>, battling monsters, hopping around gears." Author Commentary.</li>

        <li>"Dave is doing all these cool time-attack tricks. Hopping forward and backward in time, but only by a little to keep the maneuvers simple. <u>Each time he does, he's creating a little stable time loop he has to account for.</u> Good practice for a Knight of Time. Starting now, Dave gets into the habit of casually encountering himself a lot." Author Commentary.</li>

        <li>"Those block-type grists are sulphur. I wonder how many huge sulphur cubes have fallen into the lava over the course of his Knight of Time berserker fits? They're kind of like giant, stinky bouillon cubes falling into a huge vat of boiling broth. It probably absolutely reeks on LOHAC when Dave goes on a rampage." Author Commentary.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Calsprite did nothing but laugh. "Poor Dave didn't even have a decent spiritual guide to help him through this troubling dark timeline. Guess that means he had to figure a lot of things out for himself," (1642).</li>
    <li>It was about four months after John took off to kill Typheus that Future Dave decided to go back in time, though he was losing track due to all of the time traveling he was doing (1643).</li>
    <li>He and Rose had decided to progress as far as they could before he went back in time, in order to gather information and avoid repeating mistakes (1643).</li>
    <li>Their Jade presumably died during the start of SBURB/the Reckoning, never making it into the Medium (1643).</li>
    <li>They never heard from the trolls again (1643).</li>
    <li>Neither Future Rose nor Dave could kill their denizen yet either, despite being geared up and leveled much higher (1643).</li>
    <li>Future Dave's dream self was the one to visit Future Rose's dream self first, rather than the other way around (1643).</li>
    <li>"ive been through some heavy shit already hopping around on red hot gears and i-beams for like a year," (1692)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Implies that, including Davesprite's time travel, his time post-John death may have accumulated up to about a year, making him chronologically fourteen.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Davesprite took the iShades with him when he prototyped himself (1821).</li>
</ul>
