<h1 id="first-guardians">First Guardians</h1>

<ul>
    <li>"Every planet destined for intelligent life has [a First Guardian] meant to protect it, and facilitate the planet's ultimate purpose. A first guardian is typically almost as old as the planet itself, and each has a unique, circuitous origin through the knots of paradox space. They can be born into a great diversity of forms, though they all share a common, especially potent genetic sequence. The code grants them near omnipotence, and when merged with a host of great intelligence, near omniscience as well," (2253).</li>
    <li>"First Guardians are said to protect the planets they inhabit, but that's a bit of an oversimplification. They mainly protect the apparatus that is needed to begin the Sburb session and complete all the time loops leading to their arrival on the planet in the first place. This also means protecting the players of the session before they enter. It turns out the guardians have no qualms about sacrificing the well-being of the planet if it helps them achieve their primary objective," (2657). Author Commentary.</li>

<h2 id="bec">Becquerel</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Bec came to Earth via a meteor eons ago dropping off the seed that spawned the frog temple that contained the time capsule that contained him (1073). Main Page + Author Commentary</li>
    <li>Bec's birthday is 4/13 (1075).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="doc-scratch">Doc Scratch</h2>

<ul>
    <li>"[Doc Scratch] can theoretically be created in any universe that contains both a seed and Cal. Jade's cue ball doesn't end up creating another Doc Scratch in their universe, but it does end up in Rose's hands and serves as a convenient means for his further manipulation of her," (2259).</li>
