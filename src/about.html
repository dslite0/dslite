<p>i honestly don't know what to put here. i'm just some guy lol. </p>

<p>my interest in webdev started 2025/08/04. i started mainly because i wanted a backup option to <a href="https://toyhou.se/asphodels">toyhou.se</a> for storing my characters. i ended up going down a webdev rabbithole and now here i am</p>

<p>i like systems. i like figuring out and learning systems. it was kind of an inevitability that i'd end up fixating on webdev at some point, i'm really just surprised it didn't happen sooner.</p>

<p>my media interests fluctuate a lot because my brain is wired to latch onto Shiny New Thing, and i get bored easily. the stamps on the right sidebar reflect some of the fandoms i've been a part of (along with some other stuff).</p>
