<p>homestuck was a formative experience for me. while my level of interest in it waxes and wanes, i still hold my homestuck phase(s) close to my heart as an integral part of my history. i first got into it back when i was about 11 years old, and if i recall correctly, it was because of a friend/neighbor of mine who introduced it to me.</p>

<p>it had a slow start, but the characters and dialogue were charming enough to rope me in. i had the most interest in dave and davesprite as characters, picking them up as kins around 12. when dirk was introduced to the story, i immediately connected with him and did the same. the striders were by far my favorite characters in the entire webcomic, though in the end as i grew up, i related more to dirk than i did dave. my favorite trolls, on the other hand, were kanaya and terezi.</p>

<p>i can vividly remember waiting for upd8s, as well as sitting in the void waiting for hiatuses to end. i made plenty of fanart and tried my hand at making trollsonas several times, though none of them really stuck with me because of my constantly fluctuating sense of identity. i was still figuring myself out, and hadn't 100% landed on the idea of me being a guy just yet, or really anything about myself.</p>

<p>the biggest way that i interacted with the fandom was through fanfiction. i was an avid reader, and loved to read fanfics during my free time. i was struggling with depression, and reading beloved characters struggling with the same things as me brought a lot of comfort and catharsisâ€”suffice to say, i read a lot of angst, as well as a lot of hurt/comfort.</p>

<p>stories that focused on the striders being trans, or dirk being autistic, were doubly impactful. they allowed me to see myself reflected in characters in ways i'd never been able to see before.</p>

<p>there was also the litany of amazing works that hit none of those points of interest but still were incredibly written, incredibly well crafted pieces of art. homestuck was one of my biggest avenues into fandom and reading fanfiction as a whole. i'll never forget the times i spent under the covers, reading on my ipod touch on fanfiction.net.</p>

<p>on top of doing a lot of reading, i got to witness the creation of some of the most influential fan creations in fandom history be made, including things like lyricstucks. the homestuck fandom was one of the most creative fandoms i'd ever been a part of. animations like <a href="https://youtu.be/QKfP9N28buk">a lullaby for gods</a> still give me chills whenever i rewatch them.</p>

<p>i have a lot of love for homestuck and the ways that being a part of the fandom shaped me as a person. as an adult i look back on the time where i was most interested in homestuck with a lot of fondness and nostalgia. sometimes i wish i were back in those times, but i wouldn't exchange the life and growth i've experienced even for that. it's a tempting thought, though. just a little.</p>

<p>i don't know if i'd recommend it to everyone. it certainly isn't for everyone, not in pacing, not in writing, in the medium the story is told. but god, do i love this shitty little webcomic and everything it did for me. even the shittier people i've met in my life because of this comic are people that i wouldn't have been the person i am today without.</p>
