<h1 id="carapacians">Carapacians</h1>

<ul>
    <li>"Nothing about [carapacian anatomy] is ever explicit, but there are some points to speculate on. [WV]'s got the dull livestock teeth, whereas higher ranking agents of a more predatorial nature like Jack have very sharp teeth. Would it make sense for the more populous classes, soldiers, workers, farmers, to be herbivorous, while the higher-ups are carnivorous?" (672).</li>
    <li>"Carapacians can live a really long time. They don't technically age, or suffer degenerative consequences of age. So when PM thinks back to years ago, we're talking maybe a couple hundred years ago, when she wandered the desert wasteland? She could live plenty longer than that, too. Carapacians are supposed to live a long time, since each chess person has the potential to become an exile and thus wander around forever until they figure out how to rebuild civilization like Jack did as Slick. In this sense, they're a bit like anti-consorts, whose lifespans are tragically short," (1454). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"There seem to be two kinds of carapacians, i.e. chess folk. First there are the pieces that are already included in the game on startup, like the queens, kings, Jack, and various agents. Then there are many that are genetically engineered for the purposes of populating the Battlefield and waging war. Most foot soldiers like WV appear to be made this way. But the two sides also engineer some real monsters. Big lumbering things, using the genes from giant chess pieces. They grow them in big glass tubes, of course, because in science fiction that's how you do stuff like this. Labs all over meteors in the Veil are dedicated to this purpose," (1771). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"Frogs, and frog artifacts in general, are often referred to as "contraband,"" (1824). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"There was nothing even wrong with AR's regulator ensemble. It wasn't bloody or ragged or anything. This lends more credence to my theory that exiles quickly change to the nearest possible outfit when they crash in the desert, on pure instinct. Like a hermit crab changing its shell," (1963).</li>
    <li>"They clearly are programmed to understand on a primal level what's important from a gameplay perspective... Dersites are technically the "enemy" and function as a threat to the heroes, but lower-level ones like this will probably make sacrifices to ensure the heroes don't actually leave the boundaries of the game itself," (1968)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exiles">Exiles</h2>


<ul>
    <li>The exiles' commands cause uncharacteristic impulses/urges (268), and impact the players' moods (504). Inference.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"Here, John seems to be willing to just randomly start chiseling something on this tablet because PM asks him to. Maybe it's because she asks so nicely? In contrast to how WV was putting more aggressive, blunt commands in John's head, which seemed to rankle him and make him less likely to cooperate," (1490).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Exiles are the ones meant to resurrect the planet after its destruction post-Reckoning, later leading to the rebuilding of life and civilization in preparation for being seeded all over again (1524).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="wv">Wayward Vagabond</h3>

<ul>
    <li>"WV's shroud is actually the dream version of John's bedsheet." Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"WV began life as a simple farmer. It's a small enough detail that I don't actually remember if he was a defector from the Derse army who started to farm, or if he began that way because for some reason the kingdom also supplies a stock of peasants to farm the land while a battle rages on. Either way, he's an extremely war-weary guy, and not happy at all that the nice, tall grass he was farming just burned down," (1801). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>WV organized a mutiny.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="jack-noir">Jack Noir</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Jack has a policy of handing out a regisword and a hitlist to just about everyone who enters his office (1555).</li>
    <li>Jack is designed to be a cheater (1801). Author Commentary.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-midnight-crew">The Midnight Crew</h3>

<ul>
    <li>"Each member of the Midnight Crew has their own kind of candy stashed in their hat," (1164).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Spades Slick has licorice scotty dogs (1164).</li>
        <li>Hearts Boxcars has wax lips (1220).</li>
        <li>Diamonds Droog has swedish fish (1201).</li>
        <li>Clubs Deuce has licorice gummy bears (1194).</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h4 id="spades-slick">Spades Slick</h4>

<ul>
    <li>"Slick, unlike Jack, is unfamiliar with humans. He's never seen one before," (1159). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Slick is an exiled version of Jack Noir from Karkat's session (1674).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="hearts-boxcars">Hearts Boxcars</h4>

<h4 id="diamonds-droog">Diamonds Droog</h4>

<h4 id="clubs-deuce">Clubs Deuce</h4>

<h3 id="the-felt">The Felt</h3>

<h4 id="snowman">Snowman</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Snowman is an exiled version of the Black Queen from Karkat's session (1674).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="crowbar">Crowbar</h4>
<ul>
    <li>"​​The crowbar is a juju breaker. Anything that qualifies as a juju, or has juju-like qualities, can be destroyed by this thing, making it an extremely powerful and consequential object that is also a juju itself," (1312). Author Commentary.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"Crowbar's CROWBAR will destroy any temporal artifact and completely negate its effect on the timeline," (1313).</li>
    </ul>
