<h1>Trolls</h1>

<h2 id="alternia">Alternia</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Alternia started running out of movie titles after racking up thousands of years of film history (1603).</li>
    <li>"Trolls have all the same celebrities that humans do," (1603). Author Commentary.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Not Whoopi Goldberg though? (1657)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>"Trolls have their own very similar holiday, called Twelfth Perigee's Eve. The Christmas tree is literally just a huge pile of shit their lusus drags in, and they festively decorate it together," (1903). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Trolls have elves in their media (1907).</li>
    <li>"Trolls think fashion is stupid," (1996).</li>
    <li>Trolls are allowed to design their own hives after emerging victorious from the trials in the brooding caverns (2003).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"It's almost as if your people have placed great cultural importance on teaching children to become architecturally adept while very young. It has been this way since ancient times. No one seems to know why that is."</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Trolls don't have mail (2005).</li>
    <li>"Troll TV shows have shorter titles than troll movies because TV is a much newer form of media in their society," (2008).</li>
    <li>Trolls don't have to type in their quirks, but typing without them feels unnatural (2010).</li>
    <li>Trollbraile exists (2031).</li>
    <li>"On Alternia, there is no such thing as a defense attorney, or a defense," (2032).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"It also seems probable that in a real courtblock, the only thing defendants can do to improve their chances of escaping execution is not presenting a good defense (which the legislacerator only finds irritating), but dazzling the court with various acts of cunning and treachery, such as having witnesses murdered," (2039). Author Commentary.</li>
        <li>"At the same time, it's just as likely for legislacerators to respond to this gamesmanship with dirty tricks of their own, like planting evidence," (2041). Author Commentary.</li>
        <li>"As the prosecutor, it is your job to reach a final verdict and sentence the reprehensible felon, while His Tyranny watches in silence and submits grim approval," (2042).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Beetles can be embezzled, implying they are some kind of asset of value (2041).</li>
    <li>Alternia does not have Batman (2042).</li>
    <li>Human terminology for things is considered blueblood/highblood vernacular (2061).</li>
    <li>"The vast majority of adult trolls are off-planet, serving some role in the forces of ongoing imperial conquest, besieging other star systems in the name of Alternian glory. The culture and civilization on the homeworld is maintained almost entirely by the young," (2069).</li>
    <li>"Video games contained within living grubs, which you must puncture with wires to play," (2081).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>They can also be grown from scratch by trolls? Or pirated.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>"On Alternia, everything is considered unsuspecting prey by everything else," (2157).</li>
    <li>Trolls have kung fu (2161).</li>
    <li>Trolls do also use the word house (2161).</li>
    <li>Archery is associated with troll nobility (2162).</li>
    <li>"Karkat calls Flarp a game for girls, which in human culture sounds like a sexist pejorative. But knowing what we know about Flarp and trolls in general, what he probably means is, "Stop playing games for girls. They're very dangerous, and one of these days it's going to get you killed," (2176). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"Trolls don't typically bury their dead. Leaving bodies to be consumed by wild animals is more customary," (2184).</li>
    <li>"When A Virgin Mother Grub Abdicates And Renounces Brooding Her Time Will Be Relatively Short," (2204).</li>
    <li>"The fact that [Vriska and Equius] are neighbors suggests there isn't that big a divide between blue and indigo in terms of status and daily life. Both classes probably cluster together somewhat in a kind of snobby symbiosis, since they're one notch below purple-blooded clown hell, which is a radically different kind of cultural aristocracy. And both are one notch above the jade and teal middling classes, which enjoy some status, but both castes revolve around more functional, municipal services such as breeding administration and law enforcement," (2211). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Given the "movies for girls" comment, it's likely that troll romance movies are also very violent (2296). Author Commentary + Inference. </li>
    <li>"A moirail's social role is to help neutralize the threat your dangerous friend may represent to others. So breaking up with them carries an even higher cost, and therefore raises the stakes of guilt," (2328). Author Commentary.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"Romantic life for trolls is pretty dramatic. Hence the need for the pale relationships, which serve as social stabilizers," (2398). Author Commentary.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>"The need to seek out concupiscent partners comes with more urgency than typical reproductive instincts. When the IMPERIAL DRONE comes knocking, you had better be able to supply genetic material to each of his FILIAL PAILS. If you have nothing to offer, he will kill you without hesitation," (2396).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"The genetic material is a combinative genetic mix from the matesprit and kismesis pairs, respectively. The pails are all offered to the mother grub, who can only receive such precombined material."</li>
        <li>"In the slurry, more dominant genes rise to the fore, while the more recessive find less representation in the brood. Especially strong matesprit and kismesis pairings yield more dominant genetic material. The more powerful the complement or potent the rivalry, the more dominant the genes."</li>
    </ul>
    <li>"Note there's no auspistice equivalent for red romance, implying that temptation toward red infidelity is nowhere near as big a problem in troll culture," (2397). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Trolls have a cultural preoccupation with romantic destiny. "Yes, the romantic landscape is rife with false starts and miscues and infidelities, red and black. But every troll believes strongly that each quadrant holds one and only one true pairing for them, and it is just a matter of time before the grid is filled with auspicious matchups through the mysterious channels of TROLL SERENDIPITY," (2405).</li>
    <li>Trolls have horoscopes, and they have 48 total signs combined (2575).</li>
    <li>The troll equivalent of YouTube is GrubTube (2672).</li>

    <li>Alternian schoolhives had incinerators (<a href="https://beyondcanon.com/story/75" target="_blank">HSBC 75</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="alternian-troll-session">Alternian Troll Session</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The trolls' session's underlings should have had Aradia-esque properties, as Aradia prototyped herself before entering the Medium (2191).</li>
    <li>The trolls' campaign took 600 hours (2567).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="aradia" style="color: #a10000;">Aradia Megido</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The "ancestors" that Aradia had been communicating with may have been the Handmaiden herself, (2134). Author Commentary.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tavros" style="color: #a15000;">Tavros Nitram</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Tavros is allergic to cats (2164).</li>
    <li>Tavros doesn't remember the trials in the brooding caverns (2350). </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sollux" style="color: #a1a100;">Sollux Captor</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Sollux has nothing allocated in his strife specibus (2077).</li>
    <li>Sollux was the one to name the trolls' version of the game SGRUB (2134).</li>
    <li>"[Feferi's] lusus released the Vast Glub in its dying gesture to protect her from a meteor. It's been noted that, due to the fact that the psychic Glub takes some time to travel through space to wherever the Condesce's ship is, this means Sollux actually died before his own ancestor (the Helmsman) did," (2471). Author Commentary.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="karkat" style="color: #626262;">Karkat Vantas</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Trollian, as of Karkat's wriggling day, was still in beta, and Karkat had only recently been trying it out (1994).</li>
    <li>The Thresh Prince of Bel-Air is one of Karkat's favorite series (2008).</li>
    <li>"Humans sharing his blood type is another small symbolic way of hinting that Karkat is more fundamentally suited to being a human than being a troll, struggle as he might against this truth for most of his life," (2302). Author Commentary. </li>
    <li>"Karkat seems genuinely sympathetic and regretful that this is neither the time nor place to bro out with Eridan over his romantic problems. He truly enjoys hashing such things out and being there for his friends when they have quadrant issues," (2547).</li>
    <li>Karkat is canonically short (at this point in time, anyway) (2543).</li>
    <li>"[Karkat] is like a guy who, during a bout of depression, scrolls through old chatlogs or emails and beats himself up about them," (2547).</li>
    <li>Karkat passed out for about an hour when Kanaya chainsawed Tavros' lower half off (2567).</li>
    <li>Karkat barely slept during the campaign (2567).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>He stayed awake for several weeks straight (2938).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Karkat woke up on Prospit after the campaign ended (2661).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nepeta" style="color: #416600;">Nepeta Leijon</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Nepeta kills animals with her bare hands (2055).</li>
    <li>"She probably likes to toke up in her cave but keeps that on the down low. Just like her ancestor, who also was known to blaze it on occasion if I recall, with her bad clown friend," (2055). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Nepeta also likes to use blood/soot/ash to draw comics on her walls depicting her hunts (2156).</li>
    <li>Nepeta writes out everything she types (2161).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="kanaya" style="color: #008141;">Kanaya Maryam</h3>

<ul>
    <li>"[Kanaya's] living situation is very unusual by troll standards," (2322).</li>
    <li>Kanaya enjoys landscaping and engaging in the art of topiary, sculpting her trees to match the Prospitian clouds she sees in her dreams (2323).</li>
    <li>She doesn't actually hunt "the HEINOUS BROODS OF THE UNDEAD which crawl from the sand at sunrise to feast on the light and the living," as it is too dangerous (2323).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="terezi" style="color: #008282;">Terezi Pyrope</h3>

<ul>
    <li>"It's more likely that [Terezi] actually could draw well if she wanted to, but she either just literally doesn't pay the slightest attention to what she's doing when drawing, or she deliberately draws like this to lay it on thick with her blindness routine and mess with people," (1580). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Computer code tastes like lots of tiny needles and batteries to Terezi (1633).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Davesprite's color tastes like orange creamsicle (1637).</li>
        <li>Vriska's color tastes like blueberry bubblegum (2237).</li>
    </ul><li>"...it's easy to guess how Terezi can walk around and recognize forms, using something like nasal sonar, but how the hell does she read a screen? What is the resolution like? Is it really that clear? The answer is, she can vaguely smell rough shapes of light and color. But to really enhance the resolution, she needs to lick the screen, which dramatically sharpens the text and other shapes. Note how the screen here already appears bleary and smeared with saliva from previous lickings. Which implies she's just constantly licking her devices while having conversations," (2756). Author Commentary.</li>
    
</ul>

<h3 id="vriska" style="color: #005682;">Vriska Serket</h3>

<ul>
    <li>"There are definitely limitations to [Vriska's] powers. Higher bloods are immune. Everyone from Terezi and up can resist her powers. Probably Kanaya too, since it's hard to imagine her being controlled. (Though whether that's due to her blood or temperament is an open question.) Trolls lower on the hemospectrum are fair game. Tavros, Sollux...probably Nepeta too, but why would Vriska bother with her? Aradia has some resistance due to being an advanced psychic herself, in a way that Sollux is not at his lower moments (see: brain problems). So, is Vriska being truthful that she can control Karkat but just doesn't want to because his mind is unpalatable? Or is there something about his mind that makes it genuinely difficult to control, and that's just her cover story? Maybe all she can pull off are these little things. "Finger slips" as little demonstrations of power, without being able to take full control," (2178). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Vriska is a good artist (2196).</li>
    <li>"[Vriska's Vision Eightfold] is just a kind of X-ray vision. It's unclear how necessary her special lenses are to use the power. I'd probably look at it as a kind of jeweler's loupe, magnifying her power to see clearly, but not essential," (2262).</li>
    <li>Vriska's Fluorite Octet belonged to Mindfang at some point (2272). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Tavros remembers the trials in the brooding caverns (2350).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="equius" style="color: #000056;">Equius Zahhak</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Equius detests animal cruelty (2162).</li>
    <li>Equius' insane strength is implied to be a mutation (2216).</li>
    <li>Equius has a habit of talking to Gamzee daily (2220).</li>
    <li>Equius is confused by the social order of Alternia, despite his attempts to mold himself into it (2221).</li>
    <li>Equius can feel when Vriska tries to read his mind (2222).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="gamzee" style="color: #2b0057;">Gamzee Makara</h3>

<ul>
    <li>"By saying he belongs to a "rather obscure cult," I guess the text seems to be implying that among purple bloods it's rare to dress and act in this clownish way? But this turns out to be untrue. Pretty much the entire blood class is populated by a bunch of shitty clowns. What this really means is that Gamzee's specific religious beliefs are what's obscure and unusual about him, not the clowniness. NO, sadly, brutal, nasty clowns are a dime a dozen in his highblood echelon," (2012).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="eridan" style="color: #6a006a;">Eridan Ampora</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Eridan's Ahab's Crosshairs belonged to Dualscar (2456). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"Eridan at one point had a cool, mobile, pirate ship hive, which he probably cruised around the sea in during his Flarp games. Apparently at a later point it got shipwrecked on an island, and he never actually did anything about it, or simply wasn't able to," (2438). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Eridan has only spent a few days total underwater in his whole life (2448).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="feferi" style="color: #77003c;">Feferi Peixes</h3>

<ul>
    <li><li>"This kinda implies Feferi is actually really strong. Like, low-key strong. A superpower she has without making a huge deal out of it. Maybe even close to Equius-strong? That's a hell of a jump she did, just like Equius. It makes sense that those of her blood class would be sturdy as hell, judging from what we know about the Condesce," (2469).</li></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="beforus">Beforus</h2>

<ul>
    <li>"[Feferi's] royal ambition seems to be to duplicate the conditions of peace on Beforus, possibly including the part where they <u>care for the underprivileged to an extent that may be overbearing. Beforus, instead of having stratified brutal oppression, was more like a stratified nanny state.</u> Feferi seems to display this inclination with her adoption of wildlife, which doesn't need caring for either. <u>They're cared for because she wants it, not them, which is Beforus life in a nutshell</u>," (2441). Author Commentary.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="meenah" style="color: #77003c;">Meenah Peixes</h3>



<h2 id="trolls">Troll Biology and the Hemospectrum</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Troll bones are potentially not calcium-based (1903).</li>
    <li>Lowbloods are inherently more psychically susceptible (2464).</li>
    <li>Trolls can hiss (2217).</li>
    <li>Troll lips are naturally black (2326).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rustblood" style="color: #a10000;">Rust</h3>



<h3 id="bronzeblood" style="color: #a15000;">Bronze</h3>



<h3 id="goldblood" style="color: #a1a100;">Gold</h3>



<h3 id="limeblood" style="color: #658200;">Lime</h3>



<h3 id="oliveblood" style="color: #416600;">Olive</h3>



<h3 id="jadeblood" style="color: #008141;">Jade</h3>

<ul>
    <li>"Jade bloods probably have the smallest population of any individual class, aside from fuchsia." Author Commentary.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"It's a class that has more to with breeding administration than other types of grunt work, for which much bigger populations would be more useful." Author Commentary.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Jade bloods are in charge of euthanizing mutant grubs (<a href="https://beyondcanon.com/story/175" target="_blank">HSBC 175</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tealblood" style="color: #008282;">Teal</h3>



<h3 id="ceruleanblood" style="color: #005682;">Cerulean</h3>



<h3 id="indigoblood" style="color: #000056;">Indigo</h3>



<h3 id="purpleblood" style="color: #2b0057;">Purple</h3>



<h3 id="violetblood" style="color: #6a006a;">Violet</h3>

<ul>
    <li>"It felt important to adapt violet-blood themes a little to reflect this, a compromise between being a fully aquatic class and being under an air sign. Essentially, violet bloods are amphibious, and though many live under water, they spend about as much time in the open air, on boats or such. Their aquatic lusii fly through the air." Author Commentary.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fuschiablood" style="color: #77003c;">Fuschia</h3>



<h2>Lusii</h2>

<ul>
    <li>"Trolls and their custodians have a peculiar arrangement of codependence. The lusus behaves as a lifelong bodyguard, caretaker, and visceral sort of mentor, while the young troll must learn to function as a sort of zookeeper," (2070).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dragonmom">Dragonmom</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Dragonmom dreams of human babies (2058).</li>
    <li>The egg of Terezi's lusus may be her ancestor's dragon's egg (2127).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="aurthour">Aurthour</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Aurthour is part of one of the strongest lusus species on Alternia.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="seahorsedad">Seahorsedad</h3>

<ul>
    <li>"Seahorse dad flies, as do apparently many, if not all, lusii meant to raise violet-blooded trolls," (2408). Author Commentary.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="glbgolyb">Gl'bgolyb</h3>

<ul>
    <li>"<u>Gl'bgolyb is a horrorterror from the Furthest Ring, who was transported to Alternia millions of years ago</u> and dropped to the bottom of the ocean. "Gl'bgolyb" pronounced phonetically is basically just goofy eldritch-speak for "glub glub." This thing can psychically kill all trolls any time it wants, essentially making the entire species its prisoner, and is thus the basic corrupting kernel of absolute power which <u>prompted the brutal totalitarian troll civilization to evolve the way it has</u>. Each young heiress must take care of it and keep it calm, the way Feferi is doing here. Once upon a time, the young Condesce needed to do this too, before her ascendence to the throne. It is stated or implied later (I don't remember which) that <u>this monster was transported to this planet by Doc Scratch in prehistoric times, specifically to corrupt the race and develop it into a violent society</u>, which he prefers and which suits his long-term agenda. Prior to the game scratch that led to the trolls' current universe, the planet was called Beforus. This topic, you may already know, is an insane can of worms to get into. But for now, suffice it to say that Beforus did not have the same devil figure that Alternia has lurking on its moon, working to corrupt the race since birth. <u>[Beforus] therefore did not have Gl'bgolyb either, and troll society evolved in a more peaceful direction</u>," (2436).
