    <li>Cirque du Soleil filed a restraining order against Dad Egbert (253).</li>
    <li>There was an umbrellakind strife specibus in the study of John's house (1061).</li>
    <li>"On Jade's birthday, nanna was locked onto in John's neighborhood, by the Betty Crocker factory. The meteor carrying baby Jade crashed into the factory and destroyed it. Her grandpa, the owner of that factory, would adopt her. <u>John's dad witnessed, and would spend years investigating.</u>"</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mom">Mom Lalonde</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Mom Lalonde's 20 foot tall, 10 ton (1149, Author Commentary) granite statue of Zazzerpan the Learned statue was "installed through a hole in the roof with a heavy-duty crane," (358).</li>
    <li>"It is strongly implied [the SkaiaNet laboratory] is where Rose's mom grew up... Who raised her? Was it the owner of Skaianet, a younger grandpa Harley? Did he outsource parenting duties to someone else in the lab? Maybe some exiles? If so, she had an upbringing fairly similar to that of Roxy in the future," (905). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"Finally entering the Medium is a significant moment for Mom Lalonde as well. She clearly knew this day was coming. Spent most of her life doing whatever she was doing in that lab behind the house, as well as raising her daughter for this day. When the time comes, she slips out the back and gets on a boat to who knows where. She's finally free. By leaving the martini glass there, is she indicating she's finally kicking the habit too?" (1498). Author Commentary.</li>

        <li>"Mom would bring Rose to John's neighborhood to investigate the destruction of grandpa's factory, and related stellar phenomena," (1988).</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="bro">Bro Strider</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Bro had a friend(?) named Dennis, mentioned in a GameBro article on SBURB (42).</li>

    <li>The password to Bro's computer is implied to be 'lilcal' (456, 457).</li>
    <li>Bro uses the program COMPLETE BULLSHIT to monitor various sites, including Dave's various blogs and SBaHJ (459).</li>

    <li>Bro cut a meteor in half (1940).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"It seems absolutely crazy that Bro's standing on a meteor and riding it down to Earth. Until you realize (later in this very animation) that they all came down to Earth that way as infants. So it's second nature to them in a way, and they seem inoculated to the ill effects of riding a flaming meteor." Author Commentary.</li>
        <li>"I wonder how Bro's board knows what to do. Some sort of AI embedded in it? That explanation wouldn't be totally baseless." Author Commentary.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Grandpa Harley and Jade's family name is Harley because Colonel Sassacre's dog was named Halley, which Grandpa mispronounced, and then he... took that name from the dog to be his own (1921)?</li>
    <li>Grandpa Harley left Nanna to go adventuring when they were both thirteen (1922).</li>
    <li>"Grandpa stole the Fourth Wall of Jack's cubicle," (1987).</li>
