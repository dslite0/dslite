<h1 id="sburb">SBURB</h1>

<ul>
    <li>"The concept of prototyping in this game was always about distilling the prototyped elements into something more symbolic, more essential, and customizing the whole game according to the merged ideals of those components," (251).</li>
    <li>The Green Sun is twice the mass of the universe (274). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>The meteors aren't triggered by playing SBURB/connecting to client/server; the timers provided by the game instead serve as warnings for what is going to come (880).</li>
    <li>Derse (and presumably Prospit) were made using images of cathedral architecture (886). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"It is never a very good idea to be outside during the ECLIPSE" on Prospit (1051).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The eclipse is "when you are exposed to many visions of the past, present, and future through a variety of CLOUD MIRAGES," (1075).</li>
        <li>"When Prospit's moon eclipses Skaia, it drifts into Skaia for a time, mingling with the clouds," (1674).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Overlapping two punched cards (&&) grants a different result compared to punching both patterns onto the same card (||), though still utilizing the same materials (1053).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The && operator fuses items based on purpose/function, while the || operator fuses them based on design (1674).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>"Seers get talked to by queens. So do Light players, I guess," (1431). Author Commentary.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Seers can hear their exiles/the Queens more clearly than other players (1524). Inference.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Planets each have "planetary pollutants" (oil blocking the Breeze, chalk doing... something with the rain, amber gumming up the clockwork). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"Alpha timeline outcomes can depend entirely on the impact of events from doomed timelines, by way of time travelers going back in time, and effectively sacrificing themselves, to bring about necessary results," (1656). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"The scepter is a pretty special object. Aside from granting powers and size, it has Skaia itself sitting atop it. Not a mock Skaia, as an ornament, but the real Skaia, as a smaller instantiation of itself, currently contained within itself as a recursive construct. Flying into the Skaia on the scepter is exactly the same as flying into Skaia in the center of the Medium. You could then travel down to the Battlefield, find the king, and fly into Skaia all over again. But if you leave Skaia, you'd never fly out of the scepter. You'd always just fly out of Skaia." Author Commentary.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Wielding the scepter doesn't inherently give you any special powers unless you are a King, but you can still utilize the scepter itself to do things such as initiate the Reckoning.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>"[Wizards] carry the IDEA that they are magical, and so, producing conceptual concoctions where the idea is in play will yield real magical results," (1810). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"A PARADOX CLONE IS BY DEFINITION A CORRECTLY CLONED DUPLICATE THAT WILL INEVITABLY GO BACK IN TIME AND BECOME THE ORIGINAL TARGET THAT WAS CLONED. IF IT'S A MALFORMED CLONE, IT'S JUST A MEANINGLESS MUTANT THAT HAS NO BEARING ON THE STABLE LOOP CONTINUUM," (1903).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"Paradox clones are just standard clones, except that, paradoxically, the DNA comes from the very person they eventually grow up to be. So where did the DNA come from in the first place? It somehow spontaneously generated itself in paradox space, I guess. Or was "fundamental" to it in some unfathomable way." Author Commentary.</li>
        <li>Players' paradox clones (along with their Guardians' paradox clones) are sent back in time via the Reckoning, AKA when the White King is captured or killed (1907).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>"The design of the device tells us some things. It was built not just to target a source creature to base the First Guardian on, but also to accept some form of literature containing the needed DNA code. Which means that in every session of Sburb, at some point, one or more players will have unwittingly taken to transcribing the code in some written format," (1928).</li>
    <li>The Reckoning occurs over the course of a 24-hour time period, with smaller meteors going first and the largest last (1929).</li>
    <li>"The chain is definitely keeping Prospit's moon in orbit and isn't just for show. Which means if the chain is severed, the moon just gets launched along whatever trajectory it was headed on, like a stone launched by a slingshot." Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"Skaia activates its defenses in response to the Reckoning. The fact that the portals send things back in time, toward Earth, is a secondary purpose. The primary purpose is just to catch meteors and protect the Battlefield, allowing the players as much time as possible to defeat the king and create the universe. But the longer the Reckoning goes on, the more meteors come, and the more Skaia struggles to defend itself with portals. Unfortunately, every meteor it successfully diverts is sent to Earth, which is another nail in its coffin. <u>Skaia sacrifices the planet of origin so that its child (a new universe) may have a chance to be born.</u> But it simultaneously seeds the dead planet with the potential for new life and civilization (exiles), and <u>retroactively seeds the planet with the children who would fertilize Skaia with the new universe</u>. This is the essence of the universal creation cycle. Sacrifice the old to make way for the new. Life rises again from the ashes of the old. Rinse and repeat. Something else to wonder: <u>how often has Earth itself been through this process before humanity came along?</u>" (1940). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"Maybe it doesn't seem that honorable that the queen is abandoning her kingdom and whatever survivors remain. But as a game construct, she's encoded with certain instincts and objectives too. One of her chief priorities is the survival of her people, which in many cases can only be assured through exile, repopulation, and the rebuilding of civilization from scratch. Saying farewell to Prospit may be a common occurrence across all Sburb sessions. There are many ways for the game to play out, but it's not unreasonable to imagine the majority of sessions involve Prospit being ravaged in some way," (1973).</li>
    <li>"[SBURB] was developed by Skaianet, which had a lab behind Rose's house, which her mom worked in, and Mom was presumably in touch with Jade's grandpa, who habitually explored ruins, one of which may have contained Sburb's code," (2027). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Angels are mythical demons with feathery wings who Paradox Space uses to usher in the end (2082).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"Angels turn out to just be flying white monster things that either emerge from, or are composed of, the fearsome force of hope." Author Commentary.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>"[Kanaya] lives in a carbon copy of Jade's house. This implies that Jade's house is a universally available model to be salvaged from Sburb ruins and constructed, which is what Grandpa must have done," (2098). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"Prospit and Derse are meant to provide good environments for players' various "awakening experiences," which are specific to their circumstances. So it makes some sense that Terezi starts exploring her new sensory abilities in conjunction with her dream self starting to become aware," (2128). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"This one is a special bifurcated session, though, as it says there. That means it has one usual set of ruins, which always end up next to the Forge. (<u>The volcano there. All sessions start with one of those, except void sessions.</u>) And also that the future site for one of the player's homes is nearby, like Jade, Kanaya, or Jake," (2316). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>The direct effects of a Scratch are limited to the session invoking it (2605).</li>
    <li>"[SBURB is] a universe creation engine, or more specifically, a means of universal procreation, challenging young kids from planets with sentient life to either succeed or fail in the propagation of meaningful existence itself," (2624). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"The session always "knows" things about players. It knows Karkat has blood issues, so it gave him a planet full of bright red blood. It knows Dave has a thing about broken swords, which is tied up with his personal mythology related to the intersection between intense combat training for his destined role as a warrior, and deeply traumatizing abuse which causes him to resist the call to such heroism," (2828). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"Squiddles canonically are known to be Trickster Horrorterrors. A perception of the beasts that is friendlier and more comprehensible to mortal minds," (2848). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"Horrorterrors blow these [dream] bubbles, each of which serves as a little phantasmal oasis floating freely through the infinite, existentially unforgiving desert of the Furthest Ring. They stabilize a temporary realm of illusion for mortals to exist in without having to engage with the eldritch abominations just outside or the bleak expanse in which they live. So this is establishing the foundational basis for the afterlife in Paradox Space—not an eternal continuum like heaven or hell, but a purgatory of a more dubious nature, one that is actively maintained by vast, ancient monsters through a network of trillions of relatively small ephemeral bubbles. They pop, they get blown again, ghosts can drift freely from one to another," (2848). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Not prototyping your kernel is "the absolute worst thing that you could possibly do. Ever." The battlefield wouldn't be able to heal, transform, and prepare to receive the universe created from the session. (2904).</li>
    <li>"Doomed sessions have a way of building these tumors in as a means of providing a sort of self-imposed cleanup service for Paradox Space... The Tumor is a signifier that this null session is terminal, doomed from the start, thus rendering the other cleanup jobs posing as "personal quests" as moot. But ordinarily they show what Sburb has to offer: "fix" your planets to complete the cosmic quest, and "fix" yourself to complete your personal quest," (2923). Author Commentary.</li>

    <li>Alchemized food all tastes relatively similar (<a href="https://beyondcanon.com/story/105" target="_blank">HSBC 105</a>)</li>
    <li>God tier keeps physical forms from aging after reaching maturity, and their bodies do not decay after death (<a href="https://beyondcanon.com/story/286" target="_blank">HSBC 286</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dreamselves">Dreamselves</h2>

<ul>
    <li>"A dream self is actually a pretty distinct version of yourself. A separate person from your waking self, yet one whose mind is fully inhabited by your waking self's mind when you fall asleep and "wake up" as the dream self on Prospit or Derse, in the course of which the dream self is sort of "displaced" temporarily. Also, you can take over the dream self permanently if your waking self dies and is resurrected with a kiss, in which case the dream self that was inhabiting the dream body just dies. The dream self can also die independently of the waking self and then be resurrected as a totally separate person via prototyping (like Jadesprite)," (1627) Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"<u>A decent way of viewing a dream self is just as a dream-projection of the id. A collection of certain ideas about yourself, your identity.</u> Vriska's injuries aren't an important part of who she is, and if they were healed, she'd be glad to be done with them. Terezi's blindness is a big part of her identity. In fact, she was blinded by the very process of her awakening, which, if you ask me, is a more than logical way of understanding how the injury was imprinted on her dream self for good," (2578).</li>

<h3 id="time">Time</h3>

<ul>
    <li>"The unique privilege of a time player is our intrinsic knowledge of how [stagnation, cycles, routine] keeps happening," (<a href="https://beyondcanon.com/story/666" target="_blank">HSBC 666</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="light">Light</h3>

<ul>
    <li>"Light players define themselves by their direct actions and understanding," (<a href="https://beyondcanon.com/story/666" target="_blank">HSBC 666</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mind">Mind</h3>

<ul>
    <li>"While Sollux has the worst land, Terezi has one of the better ones. She's a Mind player, and so she has these trippy, pulsing synapses covering the sky. The synapses aren't just decorative; they seem to be active constructs relating to the aspect of Mind and are used that way graphically later on when she starts dabbling with her powers. They're actually somewhat similar to the clouds in Skaia. But while those clouds are windows into future or past events in Paradox Space, conveying "what you are seeing will happen, or has already happened," <u>the synapses are windows into the many potential events and their offshoots in Paradox Space, conveying "what you are seeing could happen," and it's up to a Mind player to sift through those possibilities as they become more adept with their powers</u>," (2523).
