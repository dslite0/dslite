<h1>Kids</h1>

<h2 id="beta-kids">Beta Kids</h2>

<ul>
    <li>"The Sburb beta arrived three days after it was released," (22). Main Page + Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>While John (37) and Rose (299) didn't have their strife specibi allocated pre-4/13, Dave (342) and Jade did (792).</li>
    <li>Rose is the "second youngest kid, behind John" (442). Author Commentary.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>In terms of age: Jade > Dave > Rose > John</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The Beta kids created songs collaboratively (830).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="john" style="color: #0715cd;">John/June Egbert</h3>

<ul>
    <li>John has a peanut allergy (72).</li>
    <li>John always saves the biggest presents for last (971).</li>
    <li>John changed his chumhandle from ghostyTrickster to ectoBiologist on December 1st, 2009 (1000).</li>
    <li>John likes candy corn (1066). Inference.</li>
    <li>John liked to play Crash Bandicoot (1930).</li>
    <ul><li>"I actually have strong doubts that John liked to play Crash Bandicoot. In fact, according to me, the guy who wrote this, there is a reasonably high probability that he never played it at all." Author Commentary.</li></ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="rose" style="color: #b536da;">Rose Lalonde</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The exterior walkway to the Lalondes' observatory entrance has no railings. Mom Lalonde needs to consider child-proofing/drunk-proofing the house (234).</li>
    <li>The Lalondes have several Wi-Fi signals at their disposal (239), which is later shown to be due to the large number of hubs in the SkaiaNet laboratory beneath Jaspers' mausoleum (866).</li>
    <li>A transformer distributes elecricity from the underground generator powered by the river flowing underneath the Lalondes' home (394).</li>
    <li>Rose has seen and likes Bro's websites (419).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"It's almost like they would have similar styles and would get along pretty well if bro was her age," (469). Author Commentary.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Rose finds SBaHJ funny (485). Inference.</li>
    <li>Rose's house is situated above the Rainbow Falls in the Adirondacks of New York state (742). Main Page + Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>There was a Burger King half an hour north of Rose's house (875). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>The white sand on Rose's land is actually chalk dust (1493). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Rose had an autographed copy of This Ocean Charles by Charles Barkley (that John took) (1706).</li>
    <li>Rose's land has Caulk Liches within the pink ruins (1763).</li>
    <li>Rose has a few memories from Davesprite's timeline (1858).</li>
    <li>"Rose seems intuitively more sensitive to Davesprite's existential crisis than either John or Dave are for some reason. She refers to him as Other Dave, instead of Real Dave. Maybe she isn't the warmest person, but perhaps due to spending a lot of time ruminating on grim subjects, she finds herself in a natural position of empathy for people in grim circumstances," (1858) Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"Rose starts to go a little nuts here. It might be that her partial union with her future dream self's memories has started to breed an intense hatred for this game and its cruel manifold futilities, and this one spontaneous decision to blow up her gate sets her on a path of recklessness and destruction. It's also possible she's just being a shitty teen," (1940). Author Commentary.</li>

    <li>Rose first threatened suicide when she was eight (<a href="https://beyondcanon.com/story/144" target="_blank">HSBC 144</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dave" style="color: #e00707;">Dave Strider</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Dave actually watches John's movies, or at the very least knows about what happens in them (26). Inference.</li>
    <li>Dave's shades are Ben Stiller's authentic shades from his role in Starsky and Hutch.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>They are also likely "the exact same ones that made the whole trip through Problem Sleuth," (311).</li>
        <li>They're cosmically imprinted with stars and galaxies (2615). Author Commentary.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Ideas for bands Dave may be into that no one has ever heard about, via Andrew Hussie:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Meaty Fist Glassward (312)</li>
        <li>Wrist Deep in Puppet Ass (312)</li>
        <li>Unbelievably Shitty Swords (312)</li>
        <li>Brainless Feathery Assholes (353)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Dave posted monthly satirical reviews of GameBro on (one of) his ironically maintained blogs (325).</li>
    <li>Dave is the only one of the Beta kids with a phone (not including John and his dad's PDA) (383).</li>
    <li>The Strider apartment has a crawlspace (605).</li>
    <li>Dave's dream self was already awake, but he didn't know it (1643)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"It's not totally clear here why Dave's dream self appears to be already awake while his real self is also awake. I think we must infer that his dream self is in some sort of "waking trance" where he's technically awake but too preoccupied by certain things to be considered fully awake. (Preoccupied, for instance, by Dream Cal, who has been haunting his dreams for most of his life.)" (1699).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Dave does use punctuation, primarily in situations where he has to write multiple sentences in the same paragraph, such as in his birthday letter to John (1662) or in his <a href="https://dstrider.blogspot.com/">blog posts</a>.</li>
    <li>Dave had to dump his own corpse out of his window (1864). And then stared at his blood-covered hands for ten minutes (1939).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="jade" style="color: #4ac925;">Jade Harley</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Jade's island is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean (733). Main Page + Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Jade's favorite fruit may be Mandarin Oranges (783).</li>
    <li>Jade's home was powered by geothermal power coming from the nearby volcano (801).</li>
    <li>"[Jade] likes to pretend to get into strifes with her dead grandpa," (918). Main Page + Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Jade has ridden on a bullet (980).</li>
    <li>Jade has practically pinpoint accurate aim (1114). Inference.</li>
    <li>The SBURB beta that Jade installed was actually Dave's copy, (1366, 1391, 1674).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Dave's copy got to Jade because Dave used it as a bookmark for the MEOW book, which DD then stole, and then brought to the time capsule/seed and threw the SBURB copy into, sending them back in time (1926).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Bro makes Jade nervous (1404).</li>
    <li>Jade thought that people cleaned towels with toilet water (1405).</li>
    <li>Jade had to stuff/taxidermy Grandpa Harley's corpse herself (1895).</li>
    <li>Jade made friends during her time on Prospit (1957).</li>
</ul>
