<ul>
    <li>John and his dad have debates about a picture on the wall of their home and whether or not it is Michael Cera. It is Michael Cera (47). Main Page + Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>"Unrevealed fact: when John imagined his dad's life as a street busker, he figured most people who gave him money were paying him to stop," (949).</li>
    <li>Dad Egbert had multiple birthday presents for John that he never was able to deliver himself, though John opened them on his own upon finding them (963).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="john-rose">John/June & Rose</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Rose had spent months (presumably four months, since her own birthday) accelerating her knitting skills in order to make John his birthday present (1089).</li>
    <li>Rose is "always trying to get [John] to read her weird books" (1707).</li>
    <li>Rose gifted John a bunny that she had since she could remember after repairing it with the knitting supplies that John gifted her for her own birthday (1710).</li>
    <ul>This bunny was given to her by John when she was a baby before she came down to Earth on her meteor (1931).</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="john-dave">John/June & Dave</h3>

<ul>
    <li>John sent Dave Ben Stiller's authentic shades from his role in Starsky and Hutch for his birthday with a certificate of authenticity, though it was meant to be an ironic joke (110, 318).</li>
    <li>Dave, in turn, sent John the bunny from Con Air, note of authenticity and all (132).</li>
    <li>"I like to believe that over the years Dave has accumulated thousands of pages of sent messages after John has already logged off Pesterchum," (287). Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Dave asked John for advice for what to prototype in his kernelsprite for the second prototyping (1637).</li>
    <li>"In fact, this makes it clear it was so illogical for Dave to go hitting John up for cash, that there's no way there wasn't some other motive. I think he just wanted any excuse to go chat up his good buddy. Given the chats we've seen in the past, it certainly wouldn't be the first time," (2741). Author Commentary.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="rose-mom">Rose & Mom</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Rose may have knit a shirt for her mom (217). Inference + Author Commentary.</li>
    <li>Rose gifted her mother a vacuum cleaner customized with a cup holder as an ironic gift. Mom Lalonde then bronzed it, put it on a pedestal, and left it plugged in and occasionally running at night (362).</li>

    <li>Vriska thought that she and Aradia were friends (2276).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sollux-karkat">Sollux & Karkat</h3>

    <li>Karkat thinks highly of Sollux's abilities (2026).</li>

<ul>
    <li>Karkat and Eridan talk to each other about their friends' romantic inclinations (or at least Kanaya's) (2343). Inference.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>"Eridan has something in common with Karkat in that he appears well versed in the subject of romance. Later we see that, even though they don't like each other much, they sort of act like "bros" when it comes to this subject. However, Karkat treats the subject more academically, with a sort of hobbyist's enthusiasm, and seems to carry a certain respect for the knowledge. Whereas Eridan clearly tries to exploit his knowledge of romance to his advantage, behaves manipulatively, sort of in the vein of a pickup artist (and a very unsuccessful one at that)." Author Commentary.</li>
        <li>"you fill your gossip quota wit)( your nubby )(orned bro" (2448). <- more confirmation that Eridan and Karkat gossip</li>
        <ul>
            <li>"She also references his tight bro-relations with Karkat, who he probably spills his feelings to all the time, like his red crush on Feferi." Author Commentary.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="karkat-slick">Karkat & Spades Slick</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Karkat did a good amount of traveling with Slick (2472); Author Commentary.</li>
    <ul>

        <li>Going to Terezi's planet</li>
        <li>Finding the gate on Terezi's planet</li>
        <li>Going to Gamzee's planet</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="kanaya-vriska">Kanaya & Vriska</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Vriska had wanted to meet Kanaya's lusus someday (2204).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="terezi-vriska">Terezi & Vriska (Scourge Sisters)</h3>

<ul>
    <li">"She gets flustered, whereas Terezi does not. Certain things seem to come easier for Terezi, which is part of what fuels the old rivalry. Vriska seems to have some jealousy issues about it, which were expressed in Hivebent through Terezi's more cunning manipulation methods, which don't need any special powers. Since Vriska's insecurity tells her this stuff doesn't come as easy to her as it does for Terezi, she feels like she has to cheat through use of mind control and such. The insecurity over "things come easy for her, but not for me" seems to be a lot of what's behind Vriska's brute-force approach to certain things..." (2742). Author Commentary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="vriska-equius">Vriska & Equius</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Vriska and Equius live nearby, and she frequently gets parts and technology-based favors from him (2206).</li>
    <li>Equius technically was the one who caused Spidermom's death (2233).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="jack-noir-black-queen">Jack Noir & The Black Queen</h3>

<ul>
    <li>"Jack is so pissed at his queen. These two getting testy with each other is built into their relationship across all sessions. No matter what the specific situation, she's probably always finding ways to needle him. Dress code, paperwork, it doesn't matter. This is programmed into them as game constructs to guarantee that there will always be friction between them, which allows for more interesting variations in how any given game of Sburb can play out," ([S] Jack: Ascend.). Author Commentary.</li>
