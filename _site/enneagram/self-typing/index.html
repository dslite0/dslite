<h1>self-typing guide</h1>

<p>this is a loose guide for figuring out your enneagram type. throughout this guide i'll be linking resources i've compiled into an index, which can be found all in one place <a href="/resources/enneagram">here</a>.</p>

<div class="subdiv">
    <p>keep in mind that your enneagram type is something very personal to you that requires a lot of self-awareness and introspection in order to figure out. i can't tell you for certain what your type is—only you can. it may take some time to figure it out, and this guide is not a comprehensive one.</p>

<h2 id="intro">introduction</h2>

<p>to be able to type yourself properly, it's important to know what the system you're typing yourself by actually entails.</p>

<p>the enneagram is often described as a personality type system, though the accuracy of that depends on what you consider to be your "personality". at its core, the enneagram highlights the fears and fixations people have acquired as a result of childhood experiences and wounds. according to enneagram theory, these wounds and the coping mechanisms/adaptations you've made to accomodate for them are what make up your false personality. as a result of learning some kind of message through childhood and adolescence, your attention grew narrowed towards certain fixations and passions. you took on certain behavior patterns to adjust and have your needs met. </p>

<p>while the types can have common presentations in the form of surface-level lists of traits and behaviors, it's most important to understand that those are very shallow understandings of them. you'll likely run around in circles trying to type yourself if you try to do so with what is typically understood as personality traits, or simple behaviors. you need to get to the core of things; what motivates your behaviors? why do act the way you do?</p>

<div class="subdiv"><p><b>tldr; it's not about the what, it's about the why.</b> dig deeper when examining yourself. avoid thinking about enneagram types as identities or personas to take on, or as things to flaunt. it is meant to be a system to help you overcome your limitations.</p></div>

<h2 id="core-type">core type</h2>
<h3 id="tests">step 1: tests</h3>

<p>tests are known to be wildly unreliable for self-typing, but they're not useless. the average person probably isn't going to want to comb through every single type and learn about everything from the bottom-up; you're here to find <em>your</em> type.</p>

<p>tests can help narrow things down and give you a place to start looking. they're far from definitive, but there's a lot of information to sift through, and the results will let you know where you can begin looking.</p>

<p>tests rely on a combination of self-awareness and honesty. the worst-case scenario is that you're completely off the mark about yourself and the reasons why you act the way you do. that's okay too—learning about the enneagram is meant to help you challenge your beliefs about yourself. you'll be able to unpack that suitcase as you go along and learn.</p>

<div class="subdiv">
    <p>if you have decent knowledge about the enneagram already, some tests may have less of a use for you; they can have rather on-the-nose questions and answers, and you might be able to pick out which ones correlate with which type(s).</p>
</div>

<p>i recommend taking multiple tests and seeing the most common results across the board. here are some tests that i like:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test">eclectic energies - classical enneagram test</a>
    </li>

    <li>
        <a href="https://sakinorva.net/test/enneagram"> sakinorva - enneagram test</a>
    </li>

    </li>

    <li>
        <a href="https://enneagramuserguide.com/enneagram-test/type-preference">enneagram user guide - type preference</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>take at least one of these tests (i recommend the first) and note down your results. you'll want to pay attention to the first 3-4 results.</p>

<div class="subdiv" style="padding-bottom: 40px;">
    <p align="center" class="subdiv">my highest scores were for types 9, 6, 5, and 4.</p>
    <img src="/assets/images/enneagram-test-results.png" class="center" width="200">
</div>

<h3 id="reading">step 2: reading</h3>

<p>once you've collected your results, you'll want to start looking at the descriptions for the types you scored highest on. you'll be doing a lot of reading and introspection from here on out—there's no avoiding that with self-typing, not if you want to do it right.</p>

<p>the type descriptions provided in <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheWisdomOfTheEnneagram.TheCompleteGuideToPsychologicalAndSpiritualGrowthForTheN"><i>the wisdom of the enneagram</i></a> by don richard riso and russ hudson are probably some of my favorites to start with.</p>

<p>some sources get more specific than others, or paint portraits of an example of what each type might look like. you might find descriptions that don't apply to you, even if the rest of a type's framework does. don't worry about that. find the common points mentioned across the board and across different sources, and you'll be able to form an undiluted picture of the most important parts of each type, without all of the noise.</p>

<p>here are some websites you can start to crawl through for type descriptions:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://enneagramuserguide.com/enneagram-guide/enneagram-types" target="_blank">enneagram user guide</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.fitzel.ca/enneagram/" target="_blank">fitzel.ca</a> (click the menu)</li>
    <li><a href="https://notmytypeenneagram.com/type-descriptions" target="_blank">not my type</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-descriptions/" target="_blank">the enneagram institute</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cpenneagram.com/the-nine-enneagram-types" target="_blank">openneagram</a></li>
    <li target="_blank"><a href="https://www.narrativeenneagram.org/tour-the-nine-types/">the narrative enneagram</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="subdiv">
    the types i scored highest on were 9, 6, 5, and 4, so i'd want to hone in on reading descriptions of those four first before i look at the other types (unless the description of another catches my eye).
</div>

<p>if you’re having difficulty ruling out types, it’s also worth looking into the patterns between each of the types from a bird’s eye view through the patterns and triads seen in the enneagram. here are some resources that can help you with that:</p>

</ul>

<h3 class="typing">step 3: typing</h3>

<p>by now you should have some idea of the types you see yourself most in. you may have even narrowed it down entirely to a single type. some people have "aha!" moments upon encountering their type descriptions. others, however, need some time to sit on it and think.</p>

<p>there are a couple of things to keep in mind as you figure out your type.</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>age:</b> if you're young (especially under 20) you might have a harder time typing yourself. some people even say you should leave typing yourself until you've grown a bit more. your personality is still in development when you're young, and thus a lot more turbulent compared to someone older. it can be hard to let typology systems go, especially as you're trying to figure yourself and your identity out, but you may want to let yourself cook in the oven a little longer.<br></li>

    <li><b>permanence:</b> your type will not change. what might change, however, is what you think your type is, especially in conjunction with other variables like age or mistyping. you may later down the line figure out you're not the type you thought you were at all. that's okay. but the type you land on should account for the whole of you, health levels and all.</li>
</ol>

<p>if you're still having trouble with figuring out your type, another thing you can take into consideration are the <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/how-the-enneagram-system-works/#h-directions-of-integration-growth-and-disintegration-stress">stress and security lines</a>. each type has general directions it's advised to move towards when it comes to personal growth, and the direction towards growth won't be easy. you're more likely to be looking at your type if the growth recommendations are things that will be challenging for you.</p>

<h2 id="wing">wing</h2>

<p>each type has a "wing" that it takes on in addition to the core type, taking on the traits of the types adjacent to their own on the enneagram. both wings influence the main type in some way, but there will often be a dominant wing.</p>

<img src="/assets/images/enneagram.png" class="center"><br>

<div class="subdiv">
    <p>i am a type 5, which means my wing is either 6 (5w6) or 4 (5w4). it cannot be a type that is not adjacent to 5. for example, i cannot be a 5w9.</p>
</div>

<p>to identify your wing, you'll have to see which of the wings you identify most with. that means doing a bit more reading; that is, if one of the wing options wasn't already in your type results from the tests. if it was, then figuring out your wing might be easy for you.</p>

<h2 id="instinct-stacking">instinct stacking</h2>

<p>wip</p>

<h2 id="trifix">trifix</h2>

<p>you may have heard of tritypes, or trifixes. trifix theory states that while you have a core type, you have two other types correlating with the other centers of intelligence—one from each center.</p>

<p>
    <b>instinctive/gut/anger:</b> 8, 9, 1
    <br><b>feeling/heart/shame:</b> 2, 3, 4
    <br><b>thinking/head/fear:</b> 5, 6, 7
</p>

<div class="subdiv">
    my main type is 5, from the thinking center. my instinctive center type is 9. my feeling center type is 4. in the order of strength of fixation, my trifix is 594, with my core type leading.
</div>

<p>as you've read type descriptions, you likely noticed that some types still resonated heavily with you despite not being your main type. there's a high chance that those types may have been in your wing, and if not there, then your tritype.</p>

<p>look at the types in each of the centers. which one out of each center most resonates with you? which ones did you score more highly on when taking the tests earlier? some of the tests even give you possible options for your tritype/trifix.</p>

<p>once you've identified one type from each of the other centers that aren't your main type/center, list them in the order you most heavily relate to to the one you least relate to. you should now have your trifix.</p>

<div class="subdiv">
    615 is not a valid trifix because 6 and 5 are from the same center. this trifix is also missing a type from the feeling center.
</div>

<h2 id="results">results</h3>

<p>you should now have your core type, wing, instinct stacking, and trifix. your final typing results should look something like this:</p>

<div class="subdiv">
    <p align="center">5w6 sp/sx 594</p>
</div>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">final thoughts</h3>

<p>self-typing is hard. there's no getting around that. it requires learning about the whole enneagram system itself, and there's no real easy shortcut to typing yourself, as much as we try to find one, such as with tests. i do hope that i've made things at least a little bit easier for those who have no idea where to start, though.</p>

<p>at the end of the day, type only matters as much as it has use to you and your personal growth—and everyone has something to learn from <em>all</em> of the types, not just their own.</p>
